# Level 3
Final boss ;-)

Now that we can handle prices, we want to be able
 to deal with non available campers.

We have new data: `calendars.json`.
 They indicate when campers are not available.

We now just want to show the campers that
 are available in the search results, when dates are indicated.

We hope you enjoyed this challenge!
