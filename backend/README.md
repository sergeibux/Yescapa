## Challenge
During this challenge, you will create a search engine to find the best campers to rent for your next roadtrip.
Across the 3 levels, the difficulty is raising and the engine can handle more precise searches.

## Guidelines
- Clone this repo
- Solve the levels in ascending order

For each level, write code that creates a new `results.json` file from the json data in the `data` directory.
An `expected_results.json` file is available to give you a reference on what result is expected.

## Evaluation
Our criteria:
- Correctness. The program should generate the correct output.
- Clarity. Is the code well-organized and clear?
- Robustness. Is the code easy maintenable and scalable?

## Sending your results
Once you are done, please send your results to the person you are talking to.

You can send your GitHub/Gitlab project link or zip your directory and send it via email.
If you do not use Github, don't forget to attach your .git folder.

Good luck!
