## Challenge

During this challenge, you will create a search engine to find the best campers to rent.  
Across the 3 levels, the difficulty is raising and the engine can handle more precise searches.

## Guidelines
**For each level, write code that creates a new `output/results.json` file from the files in `input` directory.
An `expected_results.json` file is available to give you a reference on what result is expected.**

- Clone this repo
- Solve the levels in ascending order

## Sending your results
Once you are done, please send your results to the person you are talking to. 

You can send your GitHub/Gitlab project link or zip your directory and send it via email.
If you do not use Github, don't forget to attach your .git folder.

Good luck!
