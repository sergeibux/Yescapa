# Level 2
Now that we have a geographic search engine, 
we decide to add prices in order to be able to find
 the cheapest camper for our next holidays.

Our list of campers is updated with pricing information.

Searches can now indicate specific dates (`start_date`and `end_date`) optionaly. 

Results are ordered by price, from cheapest to more expensive.
 If no dates are provided, the price is the `price_per_day`.
 The `weekly_discount` is applied for rentals of 7 days or more.
