Now that we have a geographic search engine, 
we decide to add prices in order to be able to find
 the cheapest camper for our next holidays.

We list of `campers` is updated with pricing information.
 The `weekly_discount` is 
applied for rentals of 7 days or more.

Searches can now indicate specific dates (`start_date`and `end_date`) optionaly. 

One last thing: results must be ordered by price, from cheapest to more expensive.
