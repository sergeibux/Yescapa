# Level 2
Now that we have a geographic search engine, 
we decide to add prices in order to be able to find
 the cheapest camper for our next holidays.

We still have the same list of `campers`.

Searches can now have dates (`tart_date`and `end_date`) optionaly. 

We add a list of `prices`. The `weekly_discount` is 
applied for rentals of 7 days or more.

One last thing: results must be ordered by price, from cheapest to more expensive.
