# Level1

In this first level, you will implement a geographic search engine. 

You have a list of `campers`. Each `camper` has a location
 (`latitude` and `longitude`).

You also have a list of `searches`. Each `search` also have a location (`latitude`and `longitude`). 

To filter the campers, use a bounding box that is 2 degrees square in total (ie, +/-1.0 from each coordinate).
